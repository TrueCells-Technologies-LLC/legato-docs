<h1><a class="anchor" id="bindings"></a>
Bindings</h1>
<p>This section allows client-side IPC API interfaces (listed in the “requires" sections of
Component.cdef files) to be "bound" to server-side interfaces (listed in the "provides" sections of Component.cdef files).</p>
<p>This allows direct control over how IPC interfaces are interconnected, thereby allowing reusable components and/or apps to be "wired" together to form a working system.</p>
<p>Bindings can be between two interfaces inside the same app (an "internal binding"), or can be between a client-side interface in this app and a server-side interface "provided" by another app (or non-app user).</p>
<p>Interface instances inside the app are identified using the executable name, component name, and the service instance name. These different parts of the interface instance identifier are separated by a period (‘.’).</p>
<p>The client interface always appears first, and an arrow (<code> -&gt; </code>) is used to separate the client interface from the server interface.</p>
<p>For example, to bind "clientExe.clientComponent.clientInterface" to "serverExe.serverComponent.serverInterface":</p>
<pre class="fragment">bindings:
{
    clientExe.clientComponent.clientInterface -&gt; serverExe.serverComponent.serverInterface
}
</pre><p>External services provided by other apps are identified using the app name and the service name, separated by a period ('.').</p>
<pre class="fragment">bindings:
{
    clientExe.clientComponent.clientInterface -&gt; otherApp.serverInterface
}
</pre><p>To bind to a service provided by a non-app user, the app name is replaced by a user name inside angle brackets.</p>
<pre class="fragment">bindings:
{
    clientExe.clientComponent.clientInterface -&gt; &lt;root&gt;.serverInterface
}
</pre><p>In the unlikely event that you built your client-side code using the <code>ifgen</code> tool or <a class="el" href="build_toolsmkcomp.html">mkcomp (Make Component)</a> or <a class="el" href="build_toolsmkexe.html">mkexe (Make Executable)</a> and then you used "requires" or "bundles" sections to get that client into your application, then the tool reading your .adef file won't know about the client-side interface. In such cases, you'll have to use a special work-around to bind those interfaces:</p>
<pre class="fragment">bindings:
{
    *.le_data -&gt; dataConnectionService.le_data
}
</pre><p>This would bind any unknown client-side "le_data" interfaces in the current app to the "le_data" server-side interface on the "dataConnectionService" app.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="bundlesAdef"></a>
Bundles</h1>
<p>Lists additional files or directories to be copied from the build host into the application so they’re available to the app at runtime (e.g., audio files, web pages, executable scripts or programs built using some external build system).</p>
<pre class="fragment">bundles:

        audio   /usr/share/sounds
    }
}
</pre><p>Three things need to be specified for each file or directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>access permissions</li>
<li>build system path</li>
<li>target path</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Access permissions</b> - any combination of one or more of the following letters, enclosed in square brackets:</p>
<ul>
<li>r = readable</li>
<li>w = writeable</li>
<li>x = executable</li>
</ul>
<p>If permissions values are not specified, then read-only ([r]) is the default.</p>
<p>Directories always have executable permission set on them, so they can be traversed. Setting the <code>[x]</code> permission in the "dir:" subsection causes the files under the directory to be made executable.</p>
<p>Setting <code>[w]</code> in the "dir:" subsection causes all files under that directory to be writeable, but the directory itself will not be writeable.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>Access permissions aren't implemented yet. For now, everything that gets installed in the application's "bin" directory on target gets "rx" permission, and all other files get "r" while all directories get "rx".</dd></dl>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Directories in the persistent (flash) file system are never made writeable because the on-target flash file system does not support usage quotas (yet).</dd></dl>
<p><b>Build system path</b> - file system path on the build PC where the file is located at build time.</p>
<p>The path can be relative to the directory where the <code></code>.adef file is located.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Environment variables can be used inside these paths.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Target path</b> - file system path on the target where the file will appear at runtime.</p>
<p>This is an absolute path inside the application's sandbox file system.</p>
<p>If this ends in a '/', then it is a directory path into which the source object (file or directory) will be copied, and the destination object will have the same name as the source object.</p>
<p>If it does not end in a '/', it is a full destination object path and the destination object may have a different name than the source object.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If the application is running unsandboxed, the bundled files and directories can be found in their installation location under "/opt/legato/apps/xxxx", where "xxxx" is replaced by the app name.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Quoting Paths</b></p>
<p>File paths can be enclosed in quotation marks (either single ' or double "). This is required when the file path contains spaces or comment start sequences </p>
<pre class="fragment">"//" or  "/*" 
</pre><p><b>File Ownership and Set-UID Bits</b></p>
<p>When the application is installed on a target: <br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>the owner and group are set to <code>root</code> on all files in the app.</li>
<li>the <code>setuid</code> bit is cleared on everything in the application.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="cpuShare"></a>
CPU Share</h1>
<p>Specifies the relative cpu share for an application.</p>
<p>Cpu share is used to calculate the cpu percentage for a process relative to all other processes in the system. New cgroups and processes default value of <b>1024</b> if not otherwise configured. The actual percentage of the cpu allocated to a process is calculated like this:</p>
<p>(share value of process) / (sum of shares from all processes contending for the cpu)</p>
<p>All processes within a cgroup share the available cpu percentage share for that cgroup like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>cgroupA is configured with the default share value, 1024.</li>
<li>cgroupB is configured with 512 as its share value.</li>
<li>cgroupC is configured with 2048 as its share value.</li>
<li>cgroupA has one process running.</li>
<li>cgroupB has two processes running.</li>
<li>cgroupC has one process running.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assumes all processes in cgroupA, cgroupB and cgroupC are running and not blocked waiting for an I/O or timer event, and another system process is also running.</p>
<p>Sum of all shares (including the one system process) is 1024 + 512 + 2048 + 1024 = 4608</p>
<p>The process in cgroupA will get 1024/4608 = 22% of the cpu. The two processes in cgroupB will share 512/4608 = 11% of the cpu, each process getting 5.5%. The process in cgroupC will get 2048/4608 = 44% of the cpu. The system process will get 1024/4608 = 22% of the cpu.</p>
<pre class="fragment">cpuShare: 512
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="executablesAdef"></a>
Executables</h1>
<p>Lists executables to be constructed and moved to the “bin” directory inside the app.</p>
<p>An executable’s content is specified inside parentheses after the name, and can be one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>relative file system path to source code file (e.g., a .c, .java, or .lua file)</li>
<li>component</li>
<li>relative file system path to library file (e.g., .a or .so file).</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>Only C/C++ source files, components, and libraries are currently supported.</dd></dl>
<pre class="fragment">executables:
{
    myexe1 = ( file1.c libgoodstuff.so )
    myexe2 = ( foobar toto )
}
</pre><p>If a component is included in an executable, then that component will be built and linked into the executable, and its COMPONENT_INIT function will be run at process start-up. Furthermore, that component’s runtime files (shared libraries, Lua source code, etc.) will be packaged inside the application for installation on the target.</p>
<p>If a source file is included in an executable, the build tools will search for it in the file system according to the source search path. When found, it will be compiled (if written in a compiled language) and linked into the executable. Note that all the source files specified for an executable will together be considered a component (which will have the same name as the executable), and one of those source files will be expected to implement a COMPONENT_INIT function, which will get called at start-up.</p>
<p>If a library (<code></code>.so or <code></code>.a file) is “included in” an executable in this way, that library is expected to be found in the “requires” or “bundles” section of the application’s .adef file or the Component.cdef file of a component that is included in the application. When the executable is linked, it will be linked with these libraries in the order in which they are listed. Note that it is permitted to list the same library more than once, as is sometimes necessary in order to satisfy all unresolved symbols, due to the single-pass nature of the linker.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which the executable is constructed will depend on the type of content and the target device. For example, C and C++ files will be compiled and linked using the appropriate compiler tool chain, depending on what target device the application is being built for. The same goes for components written in C and C++. Java code will be compiled to Java bytecode. Interpreted code, such as Python code will be simply copied into the application.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>In some cases, there may be incompatibilities between components or source code files that prevent them from being included in the same executable. For example, you may not be able to put Java sources and C sources into the same executable together. If you do violate one of these restrictions, the build tools will tell you about it.</dd></dl>

</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="maxQueuedSignals"></a>
Max Queued Signals</h1>
<p>Specifies the maximum number of signals that can be waiting for delivery to processes in the app.</p>
<p>This limit will only be enforced when using <code>sigqueue()</code> to send a signal. Signals sent using <code>kill()</code> are limited to at most one of each type of signal anyway.</p>
<p>Default is <b>100</b>.</p>
<pre class="fragment">maxQueuedSignals: 200
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="maxThreads"></a>
Max Threads</h1>
<p>Specifies the maximum number of threads allowed to run at one time: an integer number.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>A single-threaded process (a running program that doesn't start any threads other than the one running the <code>main()</code> function) counts as one thread.</dd></dl>
<p>If fork() calls or pthread_create() calls start failing with error code <code>EAGAIN</code> (seen in strace output as <code>clone()</code> system calls), then you are probably running into this limit.</p>

Fault Action</h2>
<p>This subsection specifies the action that the Supervisor should take when the process terminates with a non-zero exit code or because of an un-caught signal (e.g., SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGKILL).</p>
<p>Possible values are:</p>

<p>Default is <b>ignore</b>.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">faultAction: restart</div>

Priority</h2>
<p>Specifies the starting (and maximum) scheduling priority. A running app process can only lower its priority from this point. Once it has lowered its priority, it can't raise it again (e.g., if the process starts at medium priority and reduces to low priority, it can't go back to medium priority). The default is <b>medium</b>.</p>
<p>Values:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>idle</b> - for very low priority processes that only get CPU time if no other processes are waiting for the CPU.</li>
<li><b>low</b>, <b>medium</b>, <b>high</b> - intended for normal processes that contend for the CPU. Processes with these priorities don't preempt each other, but their priorities affect how they're inserted into the scheduling queue (high to low).</li>
<li><b>rt1</b> to <b>rt32</b> - intended for (soft) realtime processes. A higher realtime priority will preempt a lower realtime priority (ie. "rt2" would preempt "rt1"). Processes with any realtime priority will preempt processes with high, medium, low and idle priorities.</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="watchdogActionProc"></a>
Watchdog Action</h2>
<p>This subsection specifies what action the Supervisor should take when a process that has subscribed to the watchdog service fails to kick the watchdog before it expires. The possible values are the same as in Fault Action with the addition of:</p>
<p><code>stop</code> - the Supervisor terminates the process if it is still running. If no watchdog action has been supplied then the default action is to restart the process.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="watchdogTimeoutProc"></a>
Watchdog Timeout</h2>
<p>This subection specifies the length of the timeout (in milliseconds) for watchdogs called by processes in the enclosing processes section. Once a process has called <code><a class="el" href="le__wdog__interface_8h.html#a43d5abc5c44309942efbe7b9c25d811f">le_wdog_Kick()</a></code> it is registered with the software watchdog service and if it then fails to call <code><a class="el" href="le__wdog__interface_8h.html#a43d5abc5c44309942efbe7b9c25d811f">le_wdog_Kick()</a></code> within the given timeoutout, the Supervisor will be notified and the Supervisor will take the action specified in Watchdog Action.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="providesAdef"></a>
Provides</h1>
<p>The "provides:" section is used to specify things that the application provides to other apps (or non-app processes) in its runtime environment.</p>
<p>For now, only "api:" subsections are supported.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="providesApiAdef"></a>
API</h2>
<p>This subsection declares that a server-side IPC API interface is available for other apps (or non-app users) to use via <a class="el" href="def_files_adef.html#bindings">Bindings</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the following declares that the "temperature" interface on the "thermistor" component in the "sensor" executable should be made into a bindable external interface called "spaceTemp":</p>
<pre class="fragment">provides:
{
    api:
    {
        spaceTemp = sensor.thermistor.temperature
    }
}
</pre><p>If the application were called "thermometer", then other applications could bind their client-side interfaces to "thermometer.spaceTemp" to receive temperature readings from this sensor app.</p>
<p>Internal interface instances are identified using the executable name, component name, and component's interface name. These different parts of the interface instance identifier are separated by a period (‘.’).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="requiresAdef"></a>
Requires</h1>
<p>The "requires:" section is used to specify things that the application needs from its runtime environment.</p>
<p>It can contain various subsections:</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="requiresApiAdef"></a>
API</h2>
<p>Declares that a client-side IPC API interface on an executable inside the app needs to be bound to a service provided by something outside the app.</p>
<p>Interfaces inside the app are identified using the executable name, the component name, and the component's interface name, with each of these parts separated from the others by a period (‘.’).</p>
<p>For example, the following declares that the "temperature" interface on the "tempInput" component in the "controller" executable should be made into a bindable external interface:</p>
<pre class="fragment">requires:
{
    api:
    {
        controller.tempInput.temperature
    }
}
</pre><p>Outside the application, this client-side interface will be called "temperature" (thereby hiding from other apps the details of what executable and component implements the interface).</p>
<p>If the application developer wants other apps to see this interface as having a different name, it can be given a different name by adding "alias = " in front of the interface specification. For example,</p>
<pre class="fragment">requires:
{
    api:
    {
        airTemp = controller.tempInput.temperature
    }
}
</pre><p>If this app were called "thermostat", then in a <code></code>.sdef file, the interface would be called "thermostat.airTemp".</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="requiresConfigTree"></a>
Config Tree</h2>
<p>Declares that the application requires access to a given configuration tree. Each application has its own configuration tree named after the application. In addition, there's a "system" configuration tree that contains privileged system data.</p>
<p>By default, an application only has read access to its own configuration tree.</p>
<p>Applications can be granted read access or both read and write access to trees using an optional access permission specifier:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[r]</code> - grant read-only access</li>
<li><code>[w]</code> - grant read and write access</li>
</ul>
<p>If access is granted to a tree, but the access mode ("[r]" or "[w]") is not specified, then only read permission will be granted.</p>
<p>A special tree name "." can be used to refer to the app's own configuration data tree.</p>
<pre class="fragment">requires:
{
    configTree:
    {
        [w] .       // I need write access to my configuration data.
        otherApp    // I need read access to another app's configuration data.
    }
}
</pre><dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>Because configuration data may be saved to flash storage, granting write access to a configuration tree can make it possible for the application to wear out your flash device. Also, remember that granting an application write access to another application's configuration settings creates a security hole, because it makes it possible for one application to interfere with the operation of another application. It is especially dangerous to grant write access to the "system" tree. Doing so may make it possible to completely compromise the target device, either accidentally or deliberately if a hacker breaks into the app. Even read access may be dangerous if any kind of security key, including PIN and PUK codes, are kept in the system tree. As a general rule, apps should <b>never</b> be given direct access to the "system" tree.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="requiresDir"></a>
Dir</h2>
<p>Used to declare that certain directories that reside on the target device outside of the application are to be made accessible to the application.</p>
<p>The location inside the application's sandbox at which the directory will appear is also specified.</p>
<p>Things listed here are expected to be found on the target at runtime. They are not copied into the app at build time; they are made accessible to the app inside of its sandbox at runtime.</p>
<p>Each entry consists of two file system paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>first</b> path is the path to the directory <b>outside</b> of the application. This must be an absolute path (beginning with ‘/’) and can never end in a '/'.</li>
<li>The <b>second</b> path is the absolute path <b>inside</b> the app’s sandbox where the directory will appear at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paths can be enclosed in quotation marks (either single ' or double "). This is required when it contains spaces or character sequences that would start comments.</p>
<p>If the second path ends in a '/', then it is specifying the directory into which the object will appear, and the object will have the same name inside the sandbox as it has outside the sandbox.</p>
<pre class="fragment">requires:
{
    dir:
    {
        // I need access to /proc for debugging.
        /proc   /

        // For now, I want access to all executables and libraries in /bin and /lib.
        // Later I'll remove this and replace with just the files I really need in the field.
        // Also, I don't want to hide the stuff that the tools automatically bundle into my app's
        // /bin and /lib for me, so I'll make the root file system's /bin and /lib accessible as
        // my app's /usr/bin and /usr/lib.
        /bin    /usr/bin
        /lib    /usr/lib
    }
}

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>It is not possible to put anything inside of a directory that was mapped into the application from outside of the sandbox. For example, if you "require" /bin to appear at /usr/bin, you cannot then "bundle" a file into /usr/bin or "require" something to appear in /usr/bin, since that would have an effect on the contents of the /bin directory outside of the application.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="requiresFile"></a>
File</h2>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="sandboxed"></a>
Sandboxed</h1>
<p>Specifies if the app will be launched inside a sandbox.</p>
<p>Permitted content in this section is:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>true</b> - app will be run inside of a sandbox.</li>
<li><b>false</b> - app won't be run in a sandbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default is <b>true</b>.</p>
<p>If an app is not inside of a sandbox (unsandboxed), it can see the target device's real root file system. A sandboxed app can't see the target's real root file system; instead, a sandboxed app has its own, separate root file system (which it can't leave).</p>
<p>Each app has its own user ID and primary group ID. The app's user name and primary group name are both "appxxxx", where the "xxxx" is replaced with the name of the app.</p>
<p>While a user and/or group will be automatically created if missing for the specified app, only users and groups of sandboxed apps will be automatically deleted when those apps are uninstalled.</p>
